# Cooking Website

This repository contains the source code for **Craig’s Cooking Blog**, a responsive website designed to showcase delicious recipes, cooking tips and stories from the kitchen. The project is built with plain HTML and CSS—no frameworks—so it’s easy to understand and extend.

## Features

- **Home page** with a hero banner, latest recipe previews, an about preview and newsletter sign‑up.
- **Recipe index** showing all available recipes in a card‑style grid.
- **Detailed recipe pages** outlining ingredients, preparation steps and serving information.
- **About page** introducing Craig and the purpose of the blog.
- **Contact page** with a simple contact form.
- **Responsive design** so it looks great on desktops, tablets and phones.

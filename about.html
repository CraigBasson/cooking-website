      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Lana – a passionate home cook who loves exploring new recipes and sharing them with friends and family. When I'm not busy with everyday life, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen and discovering flavours from different cultures. Cooking is my creative outlet; it allows me to express myself and bring joy to those around me.</p>
      <p>This blog started as a way to document my favourite recipes and share them with others. Over time it has grown into a collection of dishes inspired by my curiosities and travels. From comforting classics to inventive fusion, each recipe is crafted to be approachable and delicious.</p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>On Lana's Kitchen you'll discover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step‑by‑step recipes with clear instructions and tips.</li>
        <li>A variety of cuisines – from Italian pastas to spicy curries and quick stir‑fries.</li>
        <li>Helpful guides on cooking techniques and kitchen tools.</li>
        <li>Stories from my culinary adventures and the science behind the food.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I believe cooking should be fun and accessible to everyone. Whether you're just learning to sauté or you're a seasoned pro, I hope my recipes inspire you to create delicious meals and memories. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
